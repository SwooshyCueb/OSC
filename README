CSE 4233 Software Architecture & Design Paradigms
Assignment 3

You will need QtCreator 4.1+/qmake, libpcre4, and libuuid in order to build
this project. OSC.pro is the qmake/qtcreator project file you should open. Do
not open OnlineShoppingCenter.pro directly. As well, an active internet
connection is required the first time you build rocksdb.

Once you have the software built, just run './OnlineShoppingCenter --help' to
get information on how to populate a sample database, and how to login from the
terminal. There are four sample users that will be put in the sample databse:
testuser001, testuser002, testuser003, and testuser004. You may log in with any
of them.

Once you've logged in, the console user interface should be fairly
self-explanatory. I highly recommend increasing the height of your terminal,
however. As well, there are a few things that may not seem obvious at first.
For example, the commands available in the cart menu change based on what's in
the cart. If you have an invalid quantity, you cannot check out. If the cart is
empty, you can't do much at all in the cart menu.
